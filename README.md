An ever evolving Cocoa Emacs 27+ setup on OSX. I'm mainly writing
Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, interfacing with Git and Bash, writing
compiled stylesheets and HTML templates, and hacking on this Elisp
dump.

## Installation

```
$ # assumes homebrew is installed and zsh is your shell
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus --with-xwidgets --HEAD 
$ git clone https://github.com/waymondo/hemacs.git "$HOME/.emacs.d"
```

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/waymondo/dotfiles) (`.bashrc`, etc.).
